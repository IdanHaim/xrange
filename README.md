# xrange.py

A pure-Python implementation of Python 2.7's `xrange` built-in, with some
features backported from the Python 3.x `range` built-in (which replaced
`xrange`) in that version.

There is no good reason you should use this in your code, its purpose was to
document and describe the behavior of the `xrange` or `range` built-ins, as
well as that of objects implementing the Sequence protocol in general.
